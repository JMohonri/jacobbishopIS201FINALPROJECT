        From the title, "Bishop's Blues," you might have expected to hear some soulful music, perhaps something full of rhythm and melody. But when you saw the cover image, full of vases and bowls, you might have been a bit surprised. No, I am unfortunately not a musician. What I am, however, is a passionate potter. And while you might be wondering, "What do pottery and blues have in common?"—the answer is, well, probably less than you'd think. Pottery, as it turns out, is more grounded than you might expect. But my favorite part? Glazing my pottery with the color blue. So, yes, "Bishop's Blues" is essentially just "Bishop's Blue Pottery," but who can resist a little alliteration?
        <br><br>
        Today, we're going to go on a riveting journey as we take a deep dive into my favorite blue hobby.
        Put on your seatbelts, kids. here we go.

        <h1>THE LIFE OF A POT</h1>
    </div>
    <br>
    <div class ="mainparagraph">
        I can tell you're really excited to learn about the life cycle of a pot! But, to be honest, it’s not quite a cycle. Once a pot has been fired, it's essentially impossible to return it to its original clay state. The process is more of a journey, with each phase marking a significant transformation. So, let’s dive into the different phases of a pottery vessel’s life:
        <ol>
            <li> Earth</li> 
            <li> Clay
                <ul>
                    <li>Throwing</li>
                    <li>Hand-Building</li>
                </ul>
            </li> 
            <li> Leatherware </li> 
            <li> Greenware </li>

            <li> Stoneware</li>
            <li> Ceramic Tile/Mosaic </li>  
        </ol>
        Now, we’ll take a closer look at each of these phases…
    <br><br>
    <!--BOX 1 - EARTH-->
        <div class="box-model">

                <h2>EARTH</h2>
                <p class="box-text">
                    Clay begins like any soil, collected in deposits all over the earth! It is a natural material found in various parts of the world, typically in regions where water has worn down rocks over millennia. This mineral-rich soil, often a combination of alumina, silica, and water, forms the foundation for many ceramic objects. The earth, with its various clay deposits, provides the raw material that potters and artisans use to create functional and decorative items that have been a part of human culture for thousands of years.
                </p>

            <div class="text-container">
                <h2>PURIFICATION</h2>
                <p class="box-text">
                    Before you can begin to shape the clay, you need to sift through the soil to get out all the larger pieces of soil, sand, and pebbles. This process is essential for ensuring that the clay has the right consistency and texture. Any impurities or large stones must be removed to prevent cracks and uneven surfaces in the finished piece. The purified clay is then ready to be mixed with water, which helps to make it malleable and ready for sculpting, whether by hand or on a pottery wheel.
                </p>
            </div>
        </div>
    <!--BOX 3 - CLAY-->

                <h2>CLAY</h2>
                <p class="box-text">
                    After the soil has been properly purified, you can work water into the clay and begin shaping it! This is the stage where creativity and technique come together. Potters use a variety of methods to shape the clay, including throwing on a wheel, handbuilding, or sculpting. Adding water makes the clay soft and workable, allowing it to take on different forms. See the section "Techniques" for different clay-building methods that range from coil building to slab construction and other traditional pottery practices.

                <h2>LEATHER</h2>
                <p class="box-text">
                    Once you have formed the initial shape of your clay, via throwing or handbuilding techniques, letting the clay dry to a half-dry state is important. This stage is called "leather-hard." At this point, the clay has dried enough to hold its shape but is still wet enough to be pliable. You can now add textures, carvings, or even join two pieces of clay together. Leather-hard clay is a critical phase for adding detail and refinement to your piece, as it maintains structural integrity while still allowing for fine adjustments.
                </p>
            </div>

    <!--BOX 5 - GREENWARE-->

            <div class="text-container">
                <h2>GREENWARE</h2>
                <p class="box-text">
                    The word "Greenware" is just a fancy potter’s term for "very dry." At this stage, the clay is no longer pliable and has lost its moisture content. It has hardened but is still susceptible to water. If the greenware comes into contact with moisture, it can return to its original clay form, making it malleable again. This stage is important for final inspections before firing, as any imperfections must be addressed before the piece undergoes its first firing.
                </p>
            </div>
        </div>
    <!--BOX 6 - GREENWARE-->

                <h2>BISQUEWARE</h2>
                <p class="box-text">
                    Once the pot has gone through the first firing, it is now referred to as "Bisqueware." This stage is a critical turning point, as the piece can no longer be turned back into clay. Although it is still porous and fragile, it has hardened enough to be handled more easily. Bisque firing is the first step in preparing the piece for glazing, as it creates a porous surface that allows the glaze to adhere. At this stage, the clay has reached a form that can withstand more processes, but it remains delicate.
                </p>
            </div>
        </div>
    <!--BOX 7 - STONEWARE-->
        <div class="box-model">
            <img src="../IMAGES/STONEWARE.png" alt="Stoneware" class="box-image">
            <div class="text-container">
                <h2>STONEWARE</h2>
                <p class="box-text">
                    Once the pot has gone through the second firing, it is now referred to as "Stoneware" or "Glazeware." This is the final "finished product," and it has reached a state where it is durable and functional. Stoneware is dense, non-porous, and can withstand water and most weathering. After the second firing, it is much stronger and more resilient, making it suitable for use as kitchenware, decorative items, or even outdoor sculptures. The glaze applied during this stage adds color and texture while also providing a protective layer.
                </p>

                <h2>CERAMIC TILE</h2>
            <p class="box-text">
                Ideally, these last two phases don’t come into play unless you really intend them to. Once a piece has gone through both the first and second firings, it can never be returned to clay. However, when a piece is shattered—either accidentally or by design—it becomes ceramic tile. This is a term for all the broken pieces that, though no longer functional in their original form, can still hold artistic value. Broken ceramics, whether from a cherished piece or a simple mistake, can still contribute to new creative projects.

                <h2>MOSAIC</h2>
                <p class="box-text">
                    Even after a piece is broken, it can still be a wonderful work of art. Those tiny pieces can be used to create mosaics, whether as intricate flooring, a cool shower wall, or, as seen in the example of a nutcracker tiled with broken pottery. Mosaics are a timeless art form that repurposes fragmented materials into visually stunning designs. Each fragment tells a story, and when arranged with care, broken pieces of pottery can become part of something new and beautiful, giving the discarded pieces a second life in an unexpected form.

    <h1>TECHNIQUES: THROWING</h1>
</div>
<br>
<div class ="mainparagraph">
    Throwing is perhaps the most iconic pottery technique, often associated with the image of a potter’s wheel spinning as a piece of clay takes shape. This technique involves centering a lump of clay on a rotating wheel, where the potter applies pressure with their hands to shape the material into symmetrical forms. While throwing is typically used for creating round or cylindrical pieces—such as bowls, cups, and vases—it requires a high degree of skill and control. The potter must be able to maintain consistent pressure and rhythm to ensure the clay stays centered and forms evenly. Throwing is as much about feel as it is about technique, as potters often learn to "listen" to the clay and respond to subtle shifts in its texture and shape during the process.

    <h1>TECHNIQUES: COIL</h1>
</div>
<br>
<div class ="mainparagraph">
Coil building is a more strenuous technique compared to throwing, but it offers greater freedom in terms of the shapes that can be created. In this method, long cylindrical coils of clay are rolled out and then stacked on top of one another, gradually building up the walls of a pot or sculpture. The potter must carefully smooth and blend the coils together to avoid visible seams and to create a cohesive form. The coil technique is excellent for making larger, more complex pieces, like urns, pots, or abstract sculptures. While it requires patience and a steady hand to ensure each coil is placed and joined correctly, it also allows for greater creative expression, as the potter can shape the piece in a more freeform manner, without the constraints of symmetry found in wheel throwing.

    <h1>TECHNIQUES: PINCH</h1>
</div>
<br>
<div class ="mainparagraph">
Pinching is one of the simplest yet most versatile pottery techniques, and it offers an incredibly tactile way to engage with the clay. It starts with a small ball of clay, which the potter holds in their hands and pinches to form the desired shape, usually a small bowl or cup. As the potter pinches the clay, they can shape it into various forms, allowing for smooth curves or sharp angles, depending on their style. Pinch pots can also be combined with other techniques, like adding handles or using multiple pinch pots to create more complex structures, such as vases, spheres, or even abstract shapes. This method is particularly loved for its simplicity and the personal connection it creates between the artist and the material, as each pinch marks a direct interaction with the clay.

    <h1>TECHNIQUES: SLAB</h1>
</div>
<br>
<div class ="mainparagraph">
Slab building is another method that utilizes flat, even pieces of clay to create functional or sculptural forms. In this technique, clay is rolled out into thin, uniform slabs that are then cut and shaped to form the walls of a pot or structure. The slabs can be joined together using scoring and slip (a mixture of clay and water), which helps the pieces bond securely. Slab construction is perfect for creating more geometric or angular shapes, like boxes, tiles, and rectangular containers, but it also lends itself well to more creative sculptures or wall hangings. This method is particularly useful when aiming for a clean, modern look or when working with designs that require straight edges or large, flat surfaces. Like the other techniques, slab building offers the artist a chance to explore new possibilities while still adhering to the core principles of handcrafting.

    Wow. Thanks for sticking with me. I’m honestly a little surprised you made it this far—don’t tell me you just hit the shortcut link to the end! If you did, no worries; <a href="#section1">feel free to restart at the top</a> and join me on this little journey. Now, as we’ve meandered through the fundamentals of pottery, I bet there’s been one lingering question on your mind: Why do I only make blue pottery? I get it—it’s a valid question. Blue pottery isn’t exactly the standard go-to for most potters. But, for me, the answer is quite simple, really. It all comes down to something much deeper than just color. It’s about a feeling, an affinity, a connection to something bigger.
    <br><br>
    I mean, just look at how much blue is on our planet! Blue is the color of life!

    Earth Loves Blue. I love blue. I love water. I love swimming. The ocean holds a magic I can't quite put into words. Every time I’m near the water, there’s this sense of calm that washes over me, a peace that only blue seems to bring. Maybe it’s the way the light dances on the waves, or how the blue sky stretches infinitely overhead, giving you a sense of boundless freedom. It’s more than just the color; it’s the way blue makes me feel—refreshed, connected to nature, and somehow grounded all at once. There’s something about the vastness of the ocean and the endless blue sky that pulls me in and anchors my thoughts, reminding me to slow down, breathe, and simply exist.
    <br><br>
    This love for blue really took root while on my mission spent in Seattle, Washington. The city, with its famously gray skies, has this unique way of casting everything in a soft, pale blue light nearly nine months of the year. The endless cloud cover, while it might seem dreary to some, actually added a magical quality to the world around me. There’s a serene beauty in those muted blues, in the calmness that comes from being surrounded by water and mist. Seattle taught me to see the beauty in blue, not just as a color, but as an atmosphere—something you could feel, not just see. That’s why when I pick up a piece of clay and start to shape it, I know that the blue glaze I apply isn’t just a choice of color—it’s a reminder of all the things I love about nature, the sea, and the skies that have shaped my world.
